A simple tv-box to connect to a TV with a webcam. Connect every channel to a specific app (Ex: channel \#4 is to call, with Skype, their grand-son who is in South America or Channel \#6 is the Instagram timeline of their daughter, etc. )

Can be easily configure trough a web admin by a member of the family with different _APIs_ (Facebook, Skype, Instagram, Blogs, Youtube channel, etc.)

Let the elderly reconnect with their family/friends/internet/...

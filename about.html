        This website is a model of <strong>Open Ideas</strong>. A place for <i>Open Business.</i>
        It's an experiment of what could be an online <strong>hub</strong> to help Non-profit or Social Businesses to share their knowledge.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        It's also a place to copy positive business locally. Take ideas, improve them and bring back your experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, a place to document what was did. For internal purpose but also to receive external feedback or help similar projects.
      </p>
      <p>
